### my history
I grew up in West Virginia where I was taught to appreciate detail oriented work and sustainable living. My experience in non-profit showed me new ways to use computer visualizations through survey collection and sample analysis. Furthering my education in Data Science honed my skills so creative ideas have a direct avenue to implementation.
